            <p>
              I was a bartender and a painter for around 20 years. In that time I learned a lot about people, animals, and art.
              COVID hit and like many of us, I had to pivot. Which is when I found Web Develoment and UI. I love it. It feels like a good fit for a creative mind link mine. It's endlessly changing, always interesting (sometimes frustating--coding amiright ðŸ¤ª), but cool as all get out.
