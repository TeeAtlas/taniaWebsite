            <p>
              This is where I tell you how cool I am.
              I was a bartender and an painter for around 20 years. I learned a lot about people during that time and a lot about animals.
              COVID hit and like many of us, I had to shift. Which is when I found UI and Web Development. I love it. It feels like a good for a creative mind link mine. It's endless changing, always interesting (sometimes frustating - coding amiright ðŸ¤ª), but cool as hell. And I hope to keep making interesting stuff.
